# Return a results table - sailor_senshi, real_name, cat and school - of all characters, containing each character's high school, their civilian name and the cat who introduced them to their magical crime-fighting destiny.

# Keep in mind some senshi were not initiated by a cat guardian and one is not in high school. The field can be left blank if this is the case.

# My Solution:

SELECT
  ss.senshi_name AS sailor_senshi,
  ss.real_name_jpn AS real_name,
  c.name AS cat,
  s.school
FROM
  sailorsenshi AS ss
LEFT OUTER JOIN
  cats AS c ON
  ss.cat_id = c.id
LEFT OUTER JOIN
  schools AS s ON
  s.id = ss.school_id

# This kata comprised of using left joins to get all results from our inital table (sailorsenshi) and only the matching results from the other two tables.
