# Using our monsters table with the following schema:

# monsters table schema
#  id
#  name
#  legs
#  arms
#  characteristics

#  return the following table:

# ** output schema**
# name
# characteristics

# Where the name is the original string repeated three times (do not add any spaces), and the characteristics are the original strings in reverse (e.g. 'abc, def, ghi' becomes 'ihg ,fed ,cba').

# My Solution:
SELECT
  CONCAT(name,name,name) AS name,
  REVERSE(characteristics) AS characteristics
FROM
  monsters

# For this kata, I chose to use the CONCAT() method to join the name of a creature 3 times in a row
# For the characteristics, all that was needed to do was use the REVERSE() method to flip the characteristics to the desired output.
