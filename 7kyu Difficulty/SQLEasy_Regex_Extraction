# Input
# You'll have a table like the following:

# name	            greeting
# Austin Gaylord	Hola que tal #4702665
# Kacie Zulauf	    Bienvenido 45454545 tal #470815 BD. WA470815

# Output
# In this practice you'll need to extract from the greeting column the number preceeded by the # symbol and place it in a new column named user_id.

# name	            greeting	                                    user_id
# Austin Gaylord	Hola que tal #4702665	                        4702665
# Kacie Zulauf	    Bienvenido 45454545 tal #470815 BD. WA470815	470815

# NOTE: To keep it simple assume that the iser_id will be having varchar type

# My Solution
SELECT 
  name,
  greeting,
  REPLACE(SUBSTRING(greeting, '#[0-9]+'), '#', '') AS user_id
FROM greetings;

# The REPLACE method allows me to replace a given string, with the intended string, 
# by removing the # symbol from the extracted user_id

# The SUBSTRING method allows me to extract the required substring needed for the user_id column.

# The '#[0-9]+' regex refers to a string starting with the # symbol, followed by any number of integers 
# due to the [0-9] and the + synbol to reference any number of repeating integers.
