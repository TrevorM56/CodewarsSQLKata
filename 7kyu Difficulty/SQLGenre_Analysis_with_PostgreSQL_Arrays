# DESCRIPTION:
#   We have a table named books with the following schema:
#    id (integer) - The unique identifier for each book entry.
#    title (varchar) - The title of the book.
#    author (varchar) - The author of the book.
#    genres (varchar[]) - An array of genres associated with the book.
#  Write a SQL query to achieve the following:
#    Return a list of genres.
#    Count the number of books in each genre.
#    List titles of the books in each genre as an array. The titles within this array should be sorted alphabetically.
#  The output should be ordered by the number of books in each genre in descending order, and then alphabetically by genre name for genres with the same book count.
# GLHF!

# Desired Output
#  The desired output should look like this:
#    genre	         | count | books
#    --------------------------------------------------------------
#    Adventure	     | 2	   | {"Harry Potter","Lord of the Rings"}
#    Dystopian	     | 2	   | {1984,"Brave New World"}
#    Fantasy	       | 2	   | {"Harry Potter","Lord of the Rings"}
#    Science Fiction | 2	   | {"Brave New World",Foundation}
#    Political	     | 1	   | {1984}

## MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  UNNEST(genres) AS genre,
  COUNT(title) AS count,
  ARRAY_AGG(title ORDER BY title) AS books
FROM
  books
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC,
  1;
