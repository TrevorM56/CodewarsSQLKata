# DESCRIPTION:
#  Write a PostgreSQL query that selects film_id, the title and special_features columns from the film table in the DVD rental database, and returns only the films that have only "Trailers" and "Deleted Scenes" as their special features. special_features is the text[] type. It represents a one-dimensional array of values, where each value is of the text data type.

# Notes:
#  for the sample tests, static dump of DVD Rental Sample Database is used, for the final solution - random tests.
#  The result should be order by title alphabetically, if title is the same - then by film_id in asc order.

# Schema:
# film table:
#  Column            | Type      | Modifiers
#  ------------------+-----------+-----------
#  film_id           | integer   | not null
#  title             | varchar   | not null
#  description       | text      | not null
#  release_year      | integer   | not null
#  language_id       | integer   | not null 
#  rental_duration   | integer   | not null
#  rental_rate       | numeric   | not null
#  length            | integer   | not null
#  replacement_cost  | numeric   | not null
#  rating            | varchar   | not null
#  last_update       | timestamp | not null
#  special_features  | text[]    | not null

# Desired Output
# The desired output should look like this:
#  film_id | title                             | special_features                       |
#  --------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
#     32   | A Shawshank Redemption            | {Trailers, Deleted Scenes}             | 
#     14   | Monty Python and the Holy Grail   | {Trailers, Deleted Scenes}             |
# ...

# My Solution:
SELECT
  film_id,
  title,
  special_features
FROM
  film
WHERE
  special_features = ARRAY['Trailers', 'Deleted Scenes'] OR
  special_features = ARRAY['Deleted Scenes', 'Trailers']
ORDER BY
  title ASC,
  film_id ASC;

# For this kata, I needed to use an array of the needed features in order to generate a table that contained only Trailers and Deleted Scenes in the special_features.
# Each array provides an avenue as to how the needed features could appear within the table.
