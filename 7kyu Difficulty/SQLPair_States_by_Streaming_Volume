# DESCRIPTION:
# You have the state_streams table, where each raw contains the abbreviation of the state and the total hours of streaming from the video hosting:

# state (String)	total_streams (Integer)
# NC	            34569
# SC	            33999
# CA	            98324
# MA	            19345
# ..	..

# Write an SQL query that selects pairs of states from the state_streams table where the total number of streams is less than a thousand of each other.
# Your query should return a result set with three columns: state_a, state_b and difference.
# Each row in the result set should represent a pair of states whose total_streams difference is less than 1000 along with displaying this difference.
# The same pair of states should not appear more than once in the result set. For example, if you have a pair (NC, SC), you should not have another pair (SC, NC) in the results.
# The states in both columns of your result set should be ordered in ascending alphabetical order. First by state_a and afterwards by state_b
# state column is unique - there are no duplicate states.

# Desired Output
# For the example above, the desired output should look like this:
# state_a	state_b	difference
# NC	    SC	    570

# MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  s1.state AS state_a,
  s2.state AS state_b,
  ABS(s1.total_streams - s2.total_streams) AS difference
FROM
  state_streams AS s1
JOIN
  state_streams AS s2 ON
    s1.state < s2.state
WHERE
  ABS(s1.total_streams - s2.total_streams) < 1000
ORDER BY
  state_a,
  state_b;
