# You will need to create SELECT statement in conjunction with LIKE.

# Please list people which have first_name with at least 6 character long

# names table schema
#  id
#  first_name
#  last_name

#  results table schema
#  first_name
#  last_name

# My Solution:
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name
FROM
  names
WHERE
  first_name LIKE '______%'

# For the like filter, I used the _ character to represent six alphanumeric values. The LIKE keyword then searches for first name entries that have atleast six alpanumeric values.
