# DESCRIPTION:
# You are given a denormalized database table called world_population with columns id, country, year, and population. The table contains population data for various countries over the years.
# Your task is to write a SQL query that finds the top 5 countries with the highest population increase strictly between the years 2000 and 2020, inclusive. The result should show the country name and the population increase in millions, rounded to 2 decimal places. The query should group the results by country and sort them in descending order based on the population increase.

# Notes:
# population_increase should be obtained by dividing the result by 1,000,000 to convert the number to millions, rounding it to 2 decimal places and afterwards by adding an abbreviation for millions, "M", to the end of result.
# for the sample test is used static actual data taken from the United Nations, for the final solution - random test.
# for this task there is no data missing, so you don't need to take into account that data for a year for some countries may be lacking
# to avoid ambiguety: by "increase" is simply meant "population at year y1 - population at year y2".

# Schema:
# world_population table:
#  Column      | Type          | Modifiers
#  ------------+---------------+-----------
#  id          | integer       | not null
#  country     | varchar(255)  | not null
#  population  | bigint        | not null
#  year        | smallint      | not null

# Desired Output
# The desired output should look like this:
#  country      | population_increase
#  -------------+-------------------+
#  China        | 436.55 M          |
#  India        | 195.85 M          | 
#  ...

# My Solution:
WITH pop_inc AS (
  SELECT
    country,
    SUM(CASE
      WHEN year = 2020 THEN population
      WHEN year = 2000 THEN - population
    END) AS population_inc
  FROM world_population
  GROUP BY
    country)
  
SELECT
  country,
  CAST(ROUND((population_inc / 1e6), 2) AS TEXT)|| ' M' AS population_increase
FROM
  pop_inc
ORDER BY
  population_inc DESC
LIMIT 5;
