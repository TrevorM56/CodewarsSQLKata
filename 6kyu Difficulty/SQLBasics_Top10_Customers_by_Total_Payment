# Overview
# For this kata we will be using the DVD Rental database.

# You are working for a company that wants to reward its top 10 customers with a free gift. You have been asked to generate a simple report that returns the top 10 customers by total amount spent ordered from highest to lowest. Total number of payments has also been requested.

# The query should output the following columns:

# customer_id [int4]
# email [varchar]
# payments_count [int]
# total_amount [float]

# and has the following requirements:
# only returns the 10 top customers, ordered by total amount spent from highest to lowest

# Database Schema

# Customer Table Schema
#  customer_id
#  store_id
#  first_name
#  last_name
#  email
#  address_id
#  activebool
#  create_date
#  last_update
#  active

# Payment Table Schema
#  payment_id
#  customer_id
#  staff_id
#  rental_id
#  amount
#  payment_date

# Rental Table Schema
#  rental_id
#  rental_date
#  inventory_id
#  customer_id
#  return_date
#  staff_id
#  last_update

# My Solution:
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.email,
  SUM(p.amount)::FLOAT AS total_amount,
  COUNT(p.amount)::INT AS payments_count
FROM
  customer AS c
INNER JOIN
  payment AS p ON
    c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY
  c.customer_id
ORDER BY
  total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
