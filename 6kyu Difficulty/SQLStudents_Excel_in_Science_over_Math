# DESCRIPTION:
#  Let's consider a case where we have a students table and a courses table. The tables have the following structure:
# students:
#  | id  | name     | email               |
#  |-----|----------|---------------------|
#  | 1   | John     | john@example.com    |
#  | 2   | Sarah    | sarah@example.com   |
#  | 3   | Robert   | robert@example.com  |
#  ...

# courses:
#  | id  | student_id | course_name | score |
#  |-----|------------|-------------|-------|
#  | 1   | 1          | Math        | 90    |
#  | 2   | 1          | Science     | 85    |
#  | 3   | 2          | Math        | 92    |
#  | 4   | 2          | Science     | 80    |
#  ...

# We need to find the students who have a higher score in Science than in Math.
# Your SQL query should return the student_id, name (the name of the student), and his or her difference in scores between these courses (named as score_difference).
# Order the result by the difference in scores in descending order, and if diffrence is the same, then by student_id in ascending order.

# Good Luck!

# Desired Output
# The desired output should look like this:
#  student_id	    name	score_difference
#           3	  Robert	              25
#           5	    Emma	               3
#           6	  Olivia	               2
#          10	   James	               2

## MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  s.id AS student_id,
  s.name,
  (science.score - math.score) AS score_difference
FROM
  students AS s
JOIN
  (SELECT
    student_id,
    MAX(score) AS score
  FROM
    courses
  WHERE
    course_name = 'Science'
  GROUP BY
    student_id) AS science 
      ON science.student_id = s.id
JOIN
  (SELECT
    student_id,
    MAX(score) AS score
  FROM
    courses
  WHERE
    course_name = 'Math'
  GROUP BY
    student_id) AS math
      ON math.student_id = s.id
WHERE
  science.score > math.score
ORDER BY
  3 DESC,
  s.id;
