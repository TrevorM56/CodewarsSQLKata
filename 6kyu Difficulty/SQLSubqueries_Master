# DESCRIPTION:
#  The objective of this Kata is to show that you are proficient at string manipulation (and perhaps that you can use extensively subqueries).
#  You will use people table but will focus solely on the name column
#    name
#    Greyson Tate Lebsack Jr.
#    Elmore Clementina O'Conner
#  you will be provided with a full name and you have to return the name in columns as follows.
#    name	first_lastname	second_lastname
#    Greyson Tate	Lebsack	Jr.
#    Elmore	Clementina	O'Conner
#  Note: Don't forget to remove spaces around names in your result.
#  Note: Due to multicultural context, if full name has more than 3 words, consider the last 2 as first_lastname and second_lastname, all other names belonging to name.

## MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN p.extra_name = '' AND p.extra_name2 = '' THEN p.name
    WHEN p.extra_name2 = '' AND p.extra_name != '' THEN p.name || ' ' || p.first_lastname
    ELSE p.name || ' ' || p.first_lastname || ' ' || p.second_lastname
  END AS name,
  CASE
    WHEN p.extra_name = '' AND p.extra_name2 = '' THEN p.first_lastname
    WHEN p.extra_name2 = '' AND p.extra_name != '' THEN p.second_lastname
    ELSE p.extra_name
  END AS first_lastname,
  CASE
    WHEN p.extra_name = '' AND p.extra_name2 = '' THEN p.second_lastname
    WHEN p.extra_name2 = '' AND p.extra_name != '' THEN p.extra_name
    ELSE p.extra_name2
  END AS second_lastname
FROM (
  SELECT
    SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 1) AS name,
    SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 2) AS first_lastname,
    SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 3) AS second_lastname,
    SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 4) AS extra_name,
    SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 5) AS extra_name2
  FROM
    people) AS p;
