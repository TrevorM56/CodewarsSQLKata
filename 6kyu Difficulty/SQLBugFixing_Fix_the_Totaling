# Oh no! Timmys been moved into the database divison of his software company but as we know Timmy loves making mistakes. Help Timmy keep his job by fixing his query...

# Timmy works for a statistical analysis company and has been given a task of totaling the number of sales on a given day grouped by each department name and then each day.

# Resultant table:
#  day (type: date) {group by} [order by asc]
#  department (type: text) {group by} [In a real world situation it is bad practice to name a column after a table]
#  sale_count (type: int)

# Query to be fixed:
SELECT 
  s.transaction_date as day,
  d.name,
  COUNT(s.id)
  FROM department d
    JOIN sale s on d.id = s.id
  group by day, d.name
  order by name desc

# My Solution
SELECT 
  DATE(s.transaction_date) AS day,
  (d.name) AS department,
  COUNT(s.id) AS sale_count
FROM 
  department AS d
INNER JOIN sale AS s ON
  d.id = s.department_id
GROUP BY
  day,
  d.name
ORDER BY
  day ASC

# First, we must extract the date from the transcaction_date in order to group by the date. The inital query did not do this.
# Next, the departments fall under the name column of the department table, so I updated the query to change the column name from name to department.
# Lastly, we ordered by the day column to ensure that the results were grouped properly and ordered by the earliest date.
