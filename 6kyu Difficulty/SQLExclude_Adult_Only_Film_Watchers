# DESCRIPTION:
#  Write an SQL query to retrieve the top 5 customers who have rented the most movies, excluding customers who have rented at least one movie with an 'NC-17' rating. 
#  Subqueries are forbidden to make the task a bit curiouser - you can use select only once

# Notes:
#  If two or more customers have the same amount of rentals then sort by last name alphabetically.

# Schema
# customer table:
#  Column       | Type     | Modifiers
#  ------------ +----------+----------
#  customer_id  | integer  | not null
#  first_name   | varchar  | not null
#  last_name    | varchar  | not null
#  email        | varchar  | not null

# inventory table:
#  Column       | Type      | Modifiers
#  ------------ +-----------+----------
#  inventory_id | integer   | not null
#  film_id      | smallint  | not null
#  store_id     | smallint  | not null

# film table:
#  Column           | Type     | Modifiers
#  -----------------+----------+----------
#  film_id          | integer  | not null
#  title            | varchar  | not null
#  description      | text     | not null
#  rating           | varchar  | not null

# rental table:
#  Column       | Type      | Modifiers
#  -------------+-----------+----------
#  rental_id    | integer   | not null
#  customer_id  | integer   | not null
#  inventory_id | integer   | not null
#  rental_date  | timestamp | not null
#  return_date  | timestamp | 

# Desired Output
# The desired output should look like this:
#  customer_id  | full_name     | total_rentals |
#  -------------+---------------+---------------+
#     32        | Jami Hayes    | 22            |
#     14        | Hosea Jacobi  | 19            |
#  ...

## MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS full_name,
  COUNT(r.rental_id) AS total_rentals
FROM
  rental AS r
JOIN
  customer AS c ON
    r.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN
  inventory AS i ON
    r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN
  film as f ON
    i.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY
  c.customer_id,
  full_name
HAVING 
  SUM(CASE
        WHEN f.rating = 'NC-17' THEN 1
        ELSE 0
     END) = 0
ORDER BY
  total_rentals DESC,
  c.last_name
LIMIT 5;
