# Description
# Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns date (without time component), a number of posts for a given date and a running (cumulative) total number of posts up until a given date. The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

# Desired Output
# The resulting set should look similar to the following:

#  date       | count | total
#  -----------+-------+-------
#  2017-01-26 |    20 |    20
#  2017-01-27 |    17 |    37
#  2017-01-28 |     7 |    44
#  2017-01-29 |     8 |    52
#  ...
# date - (DATE) date
# count - (INT) number of posts for a date
# total - (INT) a running (cumulative) number of posts up until a date

# MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) AS date,
  COUNT(created_at) AS count,
  CAST(SUM(COUNT(created_at)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE(created_at))AS INT) AS total
FROM
  posts
GROUP BY
  date;

# SECOND SOLUTION
SELECT
  (created_at)::DATE AS date,
  COUNT(created_at) AS count,
  SUM(COUNT(created_at)::INT) OVER(ORDER BY created_at :: DATE) AS total
FROM
  posts
GROUP BY
  date;
