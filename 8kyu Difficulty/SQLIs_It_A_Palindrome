# Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

# A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar.
# write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'ispalindrome' with column 'str', return a table with column 'str' and your result in a column named 'res'.

# My solution: 
UPDATE ispalindrome
  SET str = LOWER(str);

SELECT
  str,
  CASE 
    WHEN REVERSE(str) = str THEN True
    ELSE False
  END AS res
FROM ispalindrome;

# I started by updating the table and setting all values, with the SET keyword, in the str column to lowercase with the LOWER() method
# Next, I used a case statement to test the reverse of the string to the newly lowercase string by using the REVERSE() method.
# If the equation matched, it returned TRUE, as the reverse of the string matched the initial string.
