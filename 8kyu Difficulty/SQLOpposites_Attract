# DESCRIPTION:
# Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
# If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

# Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

# write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'love' with columns 'flower1' and 'flower2', return a table with all the columns and your result in a column named 'res'.
# My Solution:
SELECT
  flower1,
  flower2,
  CASE
    WHEN (flower1 + flower2) % 2 = 0 THEN False
    ELSE True
  END AS res
FROM love;

# For this kata, I used a CASE statement to determine the res column. I chose to use the modulo operator to determine if the flowers had even or odd numbering.
