# DESCRIPTION:
#  Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!
#  By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.
#  The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.
#  Good luck!

# write your SQL statement here: 
#  you are given a table 'dalmatians' with column 'n' (int)
#  return a query with column 'n' and your result in a column named 'res' (text)
#  sort results by column 'n' ascending

## MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  n,
  CASE
    WHEN n <=10 THEN 'Hardly any'
    WHEN n > 10 AND n <= 50 THEN 'More than a handful!'
    WHEN n = 101 THEN '101 DALMATIANS!!!'
    ELSE 'Woah that''s a lot of dogs!'
  END as RES
FROM
  dalmatians
ORDER BY
  n;
