# DESCRIPTION:
# For this challenge you need to PIVOT data. You have two tables, products and details. Your task is to pivot the rows in products to produce a table of products which have rows of their detail. Group and Order by the name of the Product.

# Tables and relationship below:
# products table schema
#  - id   - integer
#  - name - text

# details table schema
#  - id          - integer
#  - product_id  - integer
#  - detail      - text

# You must use the CROSSTAB statement to create a table that has the schema as below:
# CROSSTAB table schema
#  - name  - text
#  - bad   - bigint
#  - good  - bigint
#  - ok    - bigint

# If the values aren't assigned to the last three columns within the query directly, it's assumed they will be presented in the lexicographical order (i.e. if we have three values, a, b and c, then bad, good and ok will have these values respectively).
# Compare your table to the expected table to view the expected results.
# more info can be found here

# MY SOLUTION:
SELECT
  *
FROM
  CROSSTAB(
    'SELECT
      p.name,
      d.detail,
      COUNT(d.id)
    FROM
      products AS p
    JOIN
      details AS d ON
        p.id = d.product_id
    GROUP BY
      p.name,
      d.detail
    ORDER BY
      p.name,
      d.detail') AS ct (name TEXT, bad BIGINT, good BIGINT, ok BIGINT );
