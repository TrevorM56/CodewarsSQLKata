# DESCRIPTION:
# You need to create a function that calculates the number of weekdays (Monday through Friday) between two dates inclusively.
# The function should be named weekdays accept two arguments of type DATE and return an INTEGER value.

# weekdays(DATE, DATE) INTEGER

# The order of arguments shouldn't matter. To illustrate both of the following queries
# SELECT weekdays('2016-01-01', '2016-01-10');
# SELECT weekdays('2016-01-10', '2016-01-01');
# should produce the same result

#  weekdays
# ----------
#         6
# (1 row)

# MY SOLUTION:
CREATE FUNCTION weekdays(DATE, DATE)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN COUNT(days)::INT
FROM
  GENERATE_SERIES(LEAST($1, $2), GREATEST($1, $2), '1 day') AS days
WHERE
  EXTRACT(DOW FROM days) NOT IN (0, 6);

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
