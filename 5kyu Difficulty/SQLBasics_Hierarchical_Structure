# DESCRIPTION:
#  For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. You have a table employees of employees, you must order each employee by level. You must use a WITH statement and name it employee_levels after that has been defined you must select from it.
#  A Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1 and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.

# employees table schema
#  id
#  first_name
#  last_name
#  manager_id (can be NULL)

# resultant schema
#  level
#  id
#  first_name
#  last_name
#  manager_id (can be NULL)

## MY SOLUTION:
WITH RECURSIVE employee_levels(level, id, first_name, last_name, manager_id) AS (
  SELECT
    1 AS level,
    e.*
  FROM
    employees AS e
  WHERE
    e.manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    el.level + 1,
    e.*
  FROM
    employees AS e,
    employee_levels AS el
  WHERE
    e.manager_id = el.id)

SELECT
  *
FROM
  employee_levels;
