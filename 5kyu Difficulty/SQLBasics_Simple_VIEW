# DESCRIPTION:
#  For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. 
#  The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view.

# Tables and relationship below:
# resultant table schema
#  id
#  name
#  email
#  total_spending

## MY SOLUTION:
CREATE VIEW members_approved_for_voucher AS 
SELECT
  mem.id, 
  mem.name,
  email,
  total_spending
FROM (
  SELECT
    member_id AS id,
    m.name,
    email,
    SUM(price) AS total_spending
  FROM
    sales AS s
  JOIN
    products AS p ON
      s.product_id = p.id
  JOIN
    members AS m ON
      s.member_id = m.id
  JOIN (
    SELECT
      department_id AS id,
      SUM(price)
    FROM
      sales AS s
    JOIN
      products AS p ON
        s.product_id = p.id
    JOIN
      departments AS d ON
        s.department_id = d.id
    GROUP BY
      s.department_id
    HAVING
      SUM(price) > 10000) AS d ON
      s.department_id = d.id
  GROUP BY
    s.member_id,
    m.name,
    email
  HAVING
    SUM(price) > 1000
) AS mem;

SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email,
  total_spending
FROM
  members_approved_for_voucher
ORDER BY
  id;
